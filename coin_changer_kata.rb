# Write a function that takes a number of cents, and that returns
#a hash containing the least number of coins needed to generate the value of cents
# eg. if you have 11 cnts you should return {:dime=> 1, :penny =>1}
# if you have 31 cents you should return {:quarter => 1, "nickel=> 1,"}
# :penny => 1}

# Build up your coin_changer using tests.  Commit and git after every test.
